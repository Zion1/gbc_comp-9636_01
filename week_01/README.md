Week 1
======

Welcome to Building Javascript Applications (COMP 9636).

:)

Before we get started I'd like to make sure we're all on the same page.
To evaluate your existing knowledge I'd like you to create a web-biography
introducing yourself. This biography should use HTML, CSS and Javascript.

I already put one together, feel free to look at mine for ideas.

**Deliverables for Week 1:**  

1. Fork this repository to your own Github account.
2. Add a folder `lastname-firstname` in the `week-01` folder.
3. Create a `index.html` file in this folder, with a short biography.
4. Submit a pull-request back to the parent repository.
